		<p>
			Besides the processing capacity and cost issues, designing a big data architecture is another common 
			challenge for users. Big data systems must be tailored to an organization's particular needs, 
			a DIY undertaking that requires IT teams and application developers to piece together a set of tools 
			from all the available technologies. Deploying and managing big data systems also require new skills 
			compared to the ones possessed by database administrators (DBAs) and developers focused on relational 
			software.Both of those issues can be eased by using a managed cloud service, but IT managers need to 
			keep a close eye on cloud usage to make sure costs don't get out of hand. Also, migrating on-premises 
			data sets and processing workloads to the cloud is often a complex process for organizations.
			Making the data in big data systems accessible to data scientists and other analysts is also a challenge, 
			especially in distributed environments that include a mix of different platforms and data stores. 
			To help analysts find relevant data, IT and analytics teams are increasingly working to build data 
			catalogs that incorporate metadata management and data lineage functions. Data quality and data governance 
			also need to be priorities to ensure that sets of big data are clean, consistent and used properly.
