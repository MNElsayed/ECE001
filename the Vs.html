		<h2>Breaking down the <b>V</b>s of big data</h2>

		<p>
		Volume is the most commonly cited characteristic of big data. A big data environment doesn't have to contain 
		a large amount of data, but most do because of the nature of the data being collected and stored in them. 
		Clickstreams, system logs and stream processing systems are among the sources that typically produce massive 
		volumes of big data on an ongoing basis.
		</p>
		<h3>Big data also encompasses a wide variety of data types, including the following:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>structured data in databases and data warehouses based on Structured Query Language (SQL).</li>
			<li>unstructured data, such as text and document files held in Hadoop clusters or NoSQL database systems.</li>
			<li>semistructured data, such as web server logs or streaming data from sensors.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			All of the various data types can be stored together in a data lake, which typically is based on Hadoop
			or a cloud object storage service. In addition, big data applications often include multiple data sources 
			that may not otherwise be integrated. For example, a big data analytics project may attempt to gauge a 
			product's success and future sales by correlating past sales data, return data and online buyer review 
			data for that product.
		</p>
		<p>
			Velocity refers to the speed at which big data is generated and must be processed and analyzed. 
			In many cases, sets of big data are updated on a real- or near-real-time basis, instead of the daily, 
			weekly or monthly updates made in many traditional data warehouses. Big data analytics applications ingest, 
			correlate and analyze the incoming data and then render an answer or result based on an overarching query. 
			This means data scientists and other data analysts must have a detailed understanding of the available 
			data and possess some sense of what answers they're looking for to make sure the information they get is 
			valid and up to date.
		</p>
		<p>
			Managing data velocity is also important as big data analysis expands into fields like machine learning 
			and artificial intelligence (AI), where analytical processes automatically find patterns in the collected 
			data and use them to generate insights.
